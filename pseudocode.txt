Step 1: Create a webpage containing a 16*16 grid of divs, which can produce grids of other sizes as well up 100*100.

Pseudocode:
1. Initialize grid demension variable "pixel_count". Default value will be 16.
2. Initialize a for-loop that iterates "pixel_count" times. This loop generate each row.
3. Initiialize a 2nd for-loop that iterates "pixel_count" times. This loop will generate each column.
4. Within the 2nd loop, create new <div class="cell"> elements with DOM, default color: white with small border to distinguish.
5. Each time 1st for-loop iterates, the created divs will drop down one column.
6. Repeat all iterations, resulting in a grid structure on the webpage.

Update: Have a fixed size grid created that reacts to hover events. 


Step 2: Add a reset button that clears the old grid and draws it again with 
same functionality.

Pseudocode:
1. Take code from step 1 and create createBlankGrid() function.
2. Each time function is called, clear all elements from .container div for overwrite.
3. Continue the function using the same logic from step 1.
4. Outside of function, call createBlankGrid() to execute when program starts.
5. Attach addEventListener to "reset" button that calls createBlankGrid() .
6. Done!

Step 3: Upon hitting reset button, add functionality that allows user to change 
draw surface pixel count.

Pseudocode:
1. In html create input box for pixel count, deactivated.
